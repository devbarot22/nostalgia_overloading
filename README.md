# nostalgia_overloading
My first project holds a special place in my heart, inspired by the wisdom and ideals of my hero, Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam. Reflecting on it brings forth a deep sense of nostalgia. Dr. Kalam's teachings have been a guiding light, and this project stands as a testament to the growth and inspiration I've experienced. I cherish every aspect of it and embrace the lessons learned under the influence of a remarkable mentor. his love towards the nation inspires me alot. 

He'll always be in our heart, Because legend never dies.
*U would think about the childish words but this words came out of my heart.
